next todo:

add selection of multiple objects --

make it so colors return properly after deselection --

add a way to detect and display which tris/planes are hovered - probably need to do some shader work for that

** probably need to reconfigure Plane so that there is some way for it to know which tris it contains

later find a way to detect and display which edges are hovered

find a way to make axes render above other objects and distinguish them from other objects of the same color

work on some custom ui elements


make a better way to define shapes(edge index, plane index)
